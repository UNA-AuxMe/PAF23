    General information:
    - 2D top-down map. The height(z) dimension is mostly useless
      for collision detection and path planning
    - The map is based on the local car position and is only built using sensor data.
      No global positioning via GPS or similar is used.
    - The map (0/0) is the center of the hero car
    - All transformations to entities are relative to
      the hero car's coordinate system (position/heading)
    - The map's x-axis is aligned with the heading of the hero car
    - The map's y-axis points to the left of the hero car
    - Coordinate system is a right-hand system like tf2 (can be visualized in RViz)
    - The map might include the hero car as the first entity in entities
