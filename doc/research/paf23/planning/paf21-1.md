In PAF21-1, they divided the planning stage into two major components:

- Global Planner
- Local Planner

A more detailed explanation is already present in the [basics](../paf22/basics.md#paf-2021-1) chapter.

---

## Global Planner

- Reads the XODR-Files (XML) which contains the designated waypoints
- Divides the total path into small segments and assigns weights to it
- Calculates the shortest path with the Dijkstra algorithm

---

## Local Planner

- `Vehicle Controller` for speed control and steering
- `Decision-Making-Component` as finite state machine for speed control and maneuvers
