## Panoptic Segmentation

### Things and Stuff

#### Things

In computer vision, the term things generally refers to objects that have properly defined geometry and are countable, like a person, cars, animals, etc.

#### Stuff

Stuff is the term used to define objects that donâ€™t have proper geometry but are heavily identified by the texture and material like the sky, road, water bodies, etc.

### Segmentation Overview

There are three different kinds of image segmentation:
- **Semantic Segmentation**: \
    Classification of every pixel or point in an image or LIDAR map into different classes (car, person, street, ...)
- **Instance Segmentation**: \
    Detection of the different instances of things.
- **Panoptic Segmentation**: \
    Combination of semantic segmentation and instance segmentation. Detection of stuff plus instances of things.
