## Decision-making algorithms

### State machine

A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (FSA, plural: automata), finite automaton, or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model of computation.
It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time.
The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition.
An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition. Finite-state machines are of two typesâ€”deterministic finite-state machines and non-deterministic finite-state machines. A deterministic finite-state machine can be constructed equivalent to any non-deterministic one.

#### Advantages

* easy to implement
* we know most of the scenarios (finite state space)
* previous groups have solutions we could adapt/extend

#### Disadvantages

* many states necessary

### Markov Chain

A Markov chain or Markov process is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.
A countably infinite sequence, in which the chain moves state at discrete time steps, gives a discrete-time Markov chain. A continuous-time process is called a continuous-time Markov chain. It is named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov.

#### Advantages

* possible to build Markov Chain from State machine
* experience from previous projects
* only depends on current state ("memorylessness")

#### Disadvantages

* might be complicated to implement
* probabilities for transitions might need to be guessed, empirically estimated

### Decision Tree

A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility.
It is one way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements. Decision trees are commonly used in operations research, specifically in decision analysis, to help identify a strategy most likely to reach a goal, but are also a popular tool in machine learning.

#### Advantages

* easy implementation
* tree like structure usable in Machine Learning (Random Forest e.g.)

#### Disadvantages

* multiple decision trees necessary
* prediction independent of previous state

## Previous approaches

### PAF21-1

**State machine**

* 2 state machines: one for maneuvers, one for speed control
* Speed control more complex, when to brake seems like the most challenging task

**Take away**

* Some states seem to be comparable to what we are required to accomplish by the leaderboard
* Our task might be more complex, needs additional states and transitions
* I'm uncertain about an extra speed state, might be easier to handle that more locally by the local planner, maybe in combination with an observer element that keeps track of the surrounding by processing the information from `Perception`

### PAF21-2

**No clear concept**

* some sort of state machine integrated in local planner
* obstacle planner for dynamic obstacles (pedestrians, cars, bicycles)
* useful parameters which we could adapt
* path prediction for obstacles
* obstacles are only interesting if they cross the path of the ego vehicle

**Take away**

* Obstacle planner might be useful for dynamic obstacle detection if not handled elsewhere
* path prediction might reduce the number objects tracked that we could interfere with
* Also, if we adapt our local plan this path prediction of other vehicles might come in handy
* On the other hand, overhead to keep track of vehicles and maybe repredict paths if some vehicles change direction

### PSAF1(2020)

**State machine**

* Three driving functions: Driving, stopping at traffic light, stopping at stop sign
* First project iteration so state machine more simple
* still covers many important scenarios

**Take away**

* Good starting point to have a minimal viable state machine
* Need adaption depending on what information we are getting forwarded/process in the planning module

### PSAF2(2020)

**Decision tree**

* This team used a decision tree to cover the major driving scenarios
* Within the scenarios the actions are more linear
* Reminds me of the execution of a state where driving scenarios are the states and the execution the things our local planner should do within that state

**Take Away**

* Even though the approach is different, the execution might be similar to the other team algorithms
* We might not be interested in a decision tree as we want to keep the option to switch to a Markov chain, which would be more overhead if we start with a decision tree
