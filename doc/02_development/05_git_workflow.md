## Git workflow

### Git Feature Branch

#### Branch strategy

---

Two types of branches:

- Main: contains production ready code
- Feature: new branches based on main for each feature

## Git style

### Branch naming

---
Feature branch: issue number-description-of-issue      (separator: '-') generated by Github automatically

#### For example

Issue #28 called "Setup dev environment"

=> `28-setup-dev-environment`

### Branch naming workflow

The following two options are available for creating a new branch:

1. **Web Interface**: You can create a new branch by clicking the "Create branch" button in the GitHub web interface.
2. **VSCode Extension**: Alternatively, use the "GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github" extension in Visual Studio Code.

#### Branch Creation Settings

The `.vscode/settings.json` file in this repository contains settings that automatically name the branch based on the issue number and the title of the issue.

#### Creating a Branch in the Web Interface

To create a branch in the web interface, follow these steps:

#### Creating a Branch in VSCode

In Visual Studio Code, use the "GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github" extension.

1. Navigate to the "Issues" tab, where you will find queries defined in the `.vscode/settings.json` file.
2. These queries allow you to access different issues.
3. Click the button "->" to create a new branch from the selected issue, check out the branch, and assign the issue to yourself.
