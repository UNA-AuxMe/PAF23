1. **Readability and Maintainability:**
    - **Consistent Formatting:** Code should follow a consistent and readable formatting style. Tools like linters or formatters can help enforce a consistent code style.
      - [02_linting](./02_linting.md)
      - [04_coding_style](./04_coding_style.md)
    - **Meaningful Names:** Variable and function names should be descriptive and convey the purpose of the code.
    - **Comments:** Clear and concise comments should be used where necessary to explain complex logic or provide context.
2. **Code Structure:**
    - **Modularity:** Code should be organized into modular components or functions, promoting reusability and maintainability.
    - **Appropriate Use of Functions/Methods:** Functions should have a clear purpose and adhere to the single responsibility principle.
    - **Hierarchy and Nesting:** Avoid overly nested structures; use appropriate levels of indentation to enhance readability.
3. **Efficiency and Performance:**
    - **Optimized Algorithms:** Code should use efficient algorithms and data structures to achieve good performance.
    - **Avoidance of Code Smells:** Detect and eliminate code smells such as duplicated code, unnecessary complexity, or anti-patterns.
4. **Error Handling:**
    - **Effective Error Messages:** Error messages should be clear and provide useful information for debugging.
    - **Graceful Error Handling:** Code should handle errors gracefully, avoiding crashes and providing appropriate feedback.
5. **Testing:**?
    - **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Code should be accompanied by a suite of tests that cover different scenarios, ensuring reliability and maintainability.
    - **Test Readability:** Tests should be clear and easy to understand, serving as documentation for the codebase.
6. **Security:**
    - **Input Validation:** Code should validate and sanitize inputs.
7. **Documentation:**
    - **Code Comments:** In addition to in-code comments, consider external documentation for the overall project structure, APIs, and configurations.
    - **README Files:** Include a well-written README file that provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage examples.
8. **Version Control:**
    - **Commit Messages:** Use descriptive and meaningful commit messages to track changes effectively.
      - [03_commit](./03_commit.md)
    - **Branching Strategy:** Follow a consistent and well-defined branching strategy to manage code changes.
9. **Scalability:**
    - **Avoid Hardcoding:** Parameterize values that might change, making it easier to scale the application.
    - **Optimized Resource Usage:** Ensure efficient utilization of resources to support scalability.
10. **Consistency with Coding Standards:**
    - **Adherence to Coding Guidelines:** Follow established coding standards and best practices for the programming language or framework used.
