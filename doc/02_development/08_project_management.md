## Create bug or feature requests

Bugs or features can be added [here](https://github.com/ll7/paf22/issues/new/choose) or via the [issue overview](https://github.com/ll7/paf22/issues).

By clicking "New issue" in the overview or using the direct link above a wizard guides you to the creation of an issue:

The possibilities are described in the following sections.

### üêû Bug

Use this issue type if you encounter a problem which should already work.
If something is not expected to work, but you want to have it, please refer to the Feature section.

#### Example for "Bug"

The documentation says that the vehicle should detect about 90% of the traffic lights.
However, for you it ignores almost all traffic lights.

### üí° Feature

Use this template if you want a new Feature which is not implemented yet.

#### Example for "Feature"

Currently, the vehicle can't make u-turns.
Implementing the ability to perform u-turns would be a new feature.

### üöó Bug in CARLA Simulator

This is a shortcut to directly report an issue in CARLA Simulator which is not an error in this project.

#### Example for "Bug in CARLA Simulator"

CARLA simulator crashes on startup on your machine.

## Create a Pull Request

To create a pull request, go to the [branches overview](https://github.com/ll7/paf22/branches) and select ``New Pull Request`` for the branch you want to create a PR for.

Alternatively you can create a PR directly from PyCharm using the ``Pull Request`` tab on the sidebar.

For completing the pull request, fill out the template that opens up automatically.

Merge the pull request after the review process is complete and all the feedback from the reviewer has been worked in.

For more information about the review process, see [Review process](./07_review_guideline.md).
