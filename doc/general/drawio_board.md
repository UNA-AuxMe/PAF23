## Legend

Please use the predefined nodes if you´re working with the board, if you thing there is missing something please contact Marcin Kuhnert (Discord: RoyaLxPole) for the PAF24.
Explanation:

![Ziele](../assets/research_assets/drawio_legend/Ziel.jpg)

This node is primarily for the software engineers who define the goals or sub-goals to be achieved for all teams. The goals should be defined as precisely as possible.These goals are added either in a separate graph or directly above the problems.


![Team](../assets/research_assets/drawio_legend/Team.jpg)

This node is for assigning the respective teams or a person from a team. Each team is assigned its own color. Green for Perception, Red for Acting, and Blue for Planning.

![Uebergeordnetes Problem](../assets/research_assets/drawio_legend/Übergeordnetes_Problem.jpg)

This node is used to describe a higher-level problem that cannot currently be defined in detail or can be broken down into smaller problems. As described in the previous node, each team has its own color. If there is a problem that affects two teams, the color is determined by adding the colors in hexadecimal notation.

![two teams prolbem](../assets/research_assets/drawio_legend/two_teams_problem.jpg)

Example for problem that affects two teams (HEX: 00FFFF):

![Problem](../assets/research_assets/drawio_legend/Problem.jpg)![gemeinsam](../assets/research_assets/drawio_legend/gemeinsames_Problem.jpg)

This node is used to provide a description for an atomic problem that cannot be further simplified. The color coding for this node applies as described above.

![Loesungs Vorschlag](../assets/research_assets/drawio_legend/Loesungs_Vorschlag.jpg)

This node is used to describe the approach to the problem. If an issue has already been created on GitHub, the issue number should be included here.

![generell](../assets/research_assets/drawio_legend/generell.jpg)
This nodes are used to describe problems that have not yet been assigned to a team or to describe a problem that affects all teams equally.
