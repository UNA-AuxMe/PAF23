## Overview

![pytree_status](../00_assets/pytree_PAF_status.drawio.png)

### Explanation

A short explanation of all components used.

#### Selector

Tries to execute each of its child behaviors in turn until one is successful. It has a priority hierarchy from left (high priority) to right (low priority).

#### Sequence

Executes all of its child behaviors sequentially after one another until all behaviors have returned `SUCCESS` or one behavior returned `FAILURE`. In that case, the sequence is aborted. If one behaviour returns `RUNNING` the sequence halts and returns the result.

#### Behaviour

Leaf element in the tree representing the actual action that will be executed.

#### Condition

Is always the first child of a sequence. It decides if the sequence should be executed or aborted. Currently implemented as behaviour.

#### Example

To explain everything better we explain the elements with the `Intersection`-Subtree. It is located at the very left side in the preceding selector, so it will be executed with a high priority (so at first).

- The sequence `Intersection` will be executed.
  1. Behaviour `Intersection ahead` will be executed: Checks if intersection is ahead. Returns `FAILURE` if no intersection is ahead and `SUCCESS` if intersection is ahead.
     - `FAILURE`: Sequence aborts and result is returned to root selector `Priorities`. `Priorities` will continue with selector `Laneswitch`.
     - `SUCCESS`: Sequence continues with sequence `Intersection ahead`
  2. Sequence `Intersection ahead`: Executes 4 behaviours sequentially. If every behaviour is executed with `SUCCESS` the seqence will return this result to the parent sequence `Intersection`. If one behaviour returns `RUNNING` or `FAILURE` the sequence will halt and also return the result.

### Inputs and Outpus

  - `Wait lane change`

### Output

The total tree only publishes the desired velocity in the different situations (e. g. intersections) to the topic `/paf/hero/max_tree_velocity`.

## Status

### Working components

The behaviours that work currently are `Intersection` `Lanewitch`. Altough with some restrictions as no traffic light and obstacle detection information is published.

### Not working components

Due to lacking information a big part of the tree doesn't work. Overtaking currently doesn't work and some behaviors are not implemented i. e. do not contain code and subscriptions:

- `Overtake possible?`
- `Single lane with dotted line?`
- `Overtake`
- `Not slowed by car in front right`
