## Test cases

### Car with same speed in front

A car drives with the same speed and the safety distance is kept.

**Speed**: 50 km/h
**Distance**: 25 m (Rule of thumb)

### Car with lower speed in front

A car with lower speed is in front -> decreasing distance

**Speed**: 50 km/h
**Distance**: 25 m (Rule of thumb) -> decreases as car in front is slower
