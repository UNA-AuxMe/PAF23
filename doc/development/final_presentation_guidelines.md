## **Technical Aspects**

- **Zoom Recording:**
  - Are we allowed to record audio and screen?
  - The recording may be provided to PAF25 as an introduction to the project.
  - If anyone objects, please inform us in advance.

- **Presentation Equipment:**
  - Ensure that the technology works beforehand (laptop, projector, sound, internet).
  - If specific software or hardware is required, consult with the supervisors in advance.

- Which existing solutions did you build upon?
- What challenges did you face at the beginning?

ðŸ”¹ **3. Improvements & Solutions**

- What works better now?
- What solutions were implemented?
- Why were certain approaches chosen?

ðŸ”¹ **4. Validation of Improvements**
