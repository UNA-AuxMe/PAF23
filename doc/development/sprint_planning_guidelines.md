## 1. Before Sprint Planning

1. **Update Issues**
   - Visit the [Issues page](https://github.com/una-auxme/paf/issues) and:
     - Add appropriate labels to each issue.
     - Close any issues that are no longer relevant.
     - Expand and refine issue descriptions as necessary.
2. **Create a New Milestone**
   - Set up a new milestone for the upcoming sprint: [Milestones](https://github.com/una-auxme/paf/milestones).
3. **Identify Key Weaknesses**
   - Focus on identifying the biggest weaknesses of the `agent`.
   - Ask: *If you could magically solve one issue, which one would it be?*

## 2. Sprint Retrospective

Integrate learnings from the previous sprint’s retrospective. Ask:

- Were there any difficulties with communication, task breakdown, or dependencies?
- How can these issues be addressed in the upcoming sprint?

## 3. At the Start of Sprint Planning

1. **Check Current Project Status**
   - Review how many sprints are left and the current progress within the semester.
   - Keep the project’s deadline in mind when planning tasks.
2. **Brainstorm Tasks/Issues**
   - Generate meaningful tasks or issues and track them as issues in the system.
   - Focus on clarity — do not criticize, only clarify each idea.
3. **Prioritize Tasks**
   - Ask: *What tasks would make our system function (or "car") better?*
   - Prioritize tasks based on importance and impact.
4. **Identify Dependencies**
   - Ensure dependencies between tasks are clear.
5. **Estimate Task Duration**
   - For each task, provide:
     - Minimum expected time.
     - Most likely expected time.
     - Maximum time, beyond which escalation is necessary.
6. **Assign Issues to Sprint Milestone**
   - Decide which issues should be included in this sprint.

## 4. At the End of Sprint Planning

1. **Assign Tasks**
   - Assign each issue to at least one team member.
2. Capacity Planing:
   - Consider each team member's availability and workload when assigning
3. **Review for Missed Problems**
   - Have any potential problems been overlooked?
4. **Ensure Workload Distribution**
   - Confirm that everyone has an appropriate amount of work.
5. **Clarify Next Steps**
   - Does everyone know where to start and what their next steps are?
6. **Clarify Communication Expectations**
   - Define the expected communication process throughout the sprint.

## 5. After Sprint Planning

1. **Define Workflow for Each Issue**
   - When will you work on this issue?
   - How will you collaborate with others?
2. **Set Escalation Plan**
   - Define when and how issues should be escalated if problems arise.
   - Where and when do you need help?
3. **Plan Pull Requests**
   - Break down implementation into logical PR sizes
   - Define PR review requirements and assignments
   - Plan PR dependencies and merge order
   - Document testing requirements for each PR
4. **Sprint Review Preparation**
   - Prepare for the **Sprint Review** at the end of the sprint, ensuring:
     - Tasks are complete and meet the Definition of Done.
     - Documentation and demos are ready for presentation.

## 6. Daily Stand-up

- Engage in the daily asynchronous stand-up:
  - Example format: *Today, I am working on issue `#xyz`. I’m facing a challenge with this aspect, but otherwise, things are progressing well.*
