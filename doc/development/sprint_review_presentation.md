Creating a good presentation for a **Sprint Review** in PAF is important for communicating the team's achievements, identifying challenges, and planning for future work.

## 1. Group Presentations

These are technical presentations meant to present project progress from the sprint.
Not every PR has to be presented, but **each students contribution should be presented**.

**Structure of Presentation**:

- **Title Slide**: Area of contribution, PR numbers, and contributor(s).
- **Agenda**:
  - Clearly outline what will be covered.
- **Overview**:
  - Start by describing the problem or feature request being addressed.
  - Explain the goal of the changes.
- **Key Accomplishments**:
  - Summarize the technical changes made during the sprint.
  - Highlight key features implemented or problems solved.
  - Design Patterns/Architectural Choices: Explain significant technical decisions.
- **Technical Challenges and Solutions**:
  - Discuss challenges encountered and how they were resolved.
  - Outline alternative approaches considered, if any.
- **Code Review Outcomes**:
  - Summarize feedback received during peer reviews.
  - Highlight requested changes and how they were addressed.
  - Mention best practices followed and areas for improvement.
- **Testing and Validation**: Explain how the changes were tested.
  - **Automated tests**: Unit, integration, or end-to-end tests that were added or updated.
  - **Manual tests**: If manual validation was done, explain the scenarios tested.
- **Demo**: Provide a quick demo or walkthrough of the feature or bug fix that the PR addresses.
  - Prepare screenshots or recordings.
- **Next Steps**: If the changes impacts other work or needs further iterations, describe those next steps.

**Duration**: **5 minutes** per person.
