# Project management

**Summary:** We use [issues](https://github.com/una-auxme/paf/issues) and [milestones](https://github.com/una-auxme/paf/milestones) to manage the project. This document explains how to create issues and pull requests.

- [1. Create bug or feature requests](#1-create-bug-or-feature-requests)
- [2. Create a Pull Request](#2-create-a-pull-request)

## 1. Create bug or feature requests

Issues can be added via the [issues overview](https://github.com/una-auxme/paf/issues).

By clicking "New issue" in the overview you have different templates to create the issue.

## 2. Create a Pull Request

To create a pull request, go to the [branches overview](https://github.com/una-auxme/paf/branches) and select ``New Pull Request`` for the branch you want to create a PR for.
