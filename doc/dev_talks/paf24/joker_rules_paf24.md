> [!CAUTION] Presentation Only Joker Card
> We encourage all team members to only present your teammates work if absolutely necessary. The work completed by your colleagues is their responsibility, and they should be the ones to present it. Furthermore, you should only present their work if you are familiar with it and can answer questions about it. Additionally, you should be confident that your team member has completed the work to a satisfactory standard.

### 3.2. Illness or Emergency

- **Illness**: If you cannot attend due to illness, provide a medical certificate to be excused from duties without using a Joker card.
- **Emergency**: Emergencies are evaluated individually.
